This project is an exercise requested by Access Taiwan Lab.

## installation
This project is hosted by webpack dev server 
```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Then access http://localhost:8080 by browser. 

**CAUTION:** I implement and test with chrome that features are not guaranteed to be ok by other browers despite I use babel.

## features
### users list (no pagination)
url - /


### user detail (optional requirement)
url - /user/<login>

### users list with pagination (optional requirement)
url - /listpagination

## troubleshooting
1. The anonymouse usage of github api is limited to few requests, get a coffee and take a rest once you hit the limit
2. ensure the port 8080 is not occupied by other daemons or services.
